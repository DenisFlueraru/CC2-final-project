“An ode to the machines”

An interactive musical conversation with the computer.

A deconstruction of the 3 acts that put together the concept of interactivity

Using two additive synthesisers together with a rhythmic scale algorithm and the jitter matrix, I am making a musical conversation with the computer that is being brought alive in the jit window.
Listening act is made through the note input and the yellow gradient
Thinking act through the random scale note generator and the switching of the colors
Speaking act through the note feedback and blue colour.
At the end, using the jitter matrix, the information gets visualised and represents each stage: Listen, Think, Speak.
The performer will be able to play a sequence and get a generative response by the machine. This will conceptualise as a human-machine conversation.

No external libraries used, can be used with Max MSP out of the box

Play and generate notes by having a musical dialogue with the computer. In case you are stuck with a song progression use this to help you finish a track and inspire you.
